# Fire_Fighting_Robot
## Problem Statement
Fire disasters pose significant risks, potentially resulting in heavy financial losses and 
loss of lives. Challenges such as explosive materials, smoke, and high temperatures can hinder 
firefighters' access to fire sites, endangering their lives. In such hazardous environments, 
deploying fire-fighting robots proves invaluable. Utilizing IoT technology, our Firefighting robot 
aims to autonomously detect and extinguish small flames by navigating to the location. Delays in 
firefighter arrival can have dire consequences, underscoring the importance of our robot, which 
continually monitors its surroundings and swiftly intervenes to extinguish fires without 
hesitation.

## Objective and Scope:
### Objective:
The objective of our firefighting robot project is to enhance firefighting capabilities by 
deploying an autonomous robot equipped with IoT technology. This robot aims to detect and 
extinguish small flames in hazardous environments, reducing reliance on human intervention and 
minimizing the risk to firefighters' lives. By providing swift and efficient responses to fire 
incidents, the objective of our prototype is to mitigate financial losses and prevent the loss of 
lives associated with fire disasters.
### Scope:
The scope of the project involves designing and implementing an autonomous 
firefighting robot equipped with IoT technology. The robot will operate within a predefined 
boundary range, detecting and extinguishing small flames within its vicinity. It will utilize 
sensors to detect fires and navigate towards them if they are outside its initial range, effectively 
responding to fire incidents. Stakeholders can receive real-time notifications once the flame is 
detected or extinguished, allowing for prompt monitoring and response. However, it has 
limitations in obstacle detection, meaning it may not avoid obstacles in its path. The robot will 
operate on a continuous power supply rather than relying on batteries. Overall, the project aims 
to enhance firefighting capabilities, reduce human intervention, and mitigate risks associated 
with fire disasters. The features of the project can be briefly explained as follows:
- Flame detection system: Integrating the flame detection sensors to identify and locate 
fire incidents within the robot's operational range (approximately 50cm).
- Fire extinguishing procedure: Implementing a submersible water pump for 
extinguishing fires, that sprays water for a certain amount of time when a flame is 
detected within the given range.
- Navigation towards the fire: Developing the robot to navigate autonomously within its 
range, ensuring proper directions (left, right, and straight) in response to fire location.
- Actuation mechanism design: Incorporating relays for controlled deployment of water 
to extinguish flames.
- Mobile Application and notification management: Creation of a simple interface using 
BLYNK IOT for viewing the intensity of the fire in the app interface and enabling 
notifications about the fire detection in the rang
