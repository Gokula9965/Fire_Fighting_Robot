## Problem Statement
Fire disasters pose significant risks, potentially resulting in heavy financial losses and 
loss of lives. Challenges such as explosive materials, smoke, and high temperatures can hinder 
firefighters' access to fire sites, endangering their lives. In such hazardous environments, 
deploying fire-fighting robots proves invaluable. Utilizing IoT technology, our Firefighting robot 
aims to autonomously detect and extinguish small flames by navigating to the location. Delays in 
firefighter arrival can have dire consequences, underscoring the importance of our robot, which 
continually monitors its surroundings and swiftly intervenes to extinguish fires without 
hesitation.
